## Monday

When we first came in we were assigned desks and laptops for the week. We started the day by doing icebreakers in the Bolger Suite with Jen, James, Pat and Dominic. We were assigned famous people or characters and had to ask questions to figure out who we were. James gave a small talk about the company and it's history. Then we were given a tour of the office by Becky and we played Mario Kart as a group and had a lunch break. 
After lunch we had a workshop on agile. David showed us a presentation and explained to us what agile was and how it is put into practice. We put the method into practice by making Mr. Potato Heads in groups. We had to make changes to our Potato Heads according to the needs of our customers, Jen and Pat. We then presented our Potato Heads to the group, explaining our choices while making it. At the end of the day we created GitHub accouts so we could edit our blog throughout the week.

## Tuesday

When we came in in the morning we had a stand-up in the Bolger Suite where we went around th room and individually said what we did yesterday and what we will be doing throughout the coming day, we would continue these meeting throughout the week. After the stand-up, Pat taught us about a type of coding called bash. He taught how to use it and how to perform some basic commands. Then Pat showed us how to edit our blogs on GitHub on our own forks and save our work in commits, and then how to send a pull request to get our commits added to the main repo. 
After that we had lunch break for an hour and after lunch we reconvined in the Bolger Suite to have a talk about student life from some current employees and student employees and they told us stories about their time in college and how they came to Red Hat. After that talk we had a talk about women in tech from a women who studied many different fields and different courses, but eventually ended up in computer science and is currently studying in college and working part-time in Red Hat. We asked as many questions as we wanted and after all the talks, we filled in our blogs on for the day at our desks.
