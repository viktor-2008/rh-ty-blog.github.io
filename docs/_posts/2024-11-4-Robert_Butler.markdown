## TY Work Experience at Red Hat in Waterford city

* 


## Monday
![Red Hat Office](https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/toy-story-mr-potato-head.jpg)

I arrived at Red Hat just before 10 and the first thing I did at red hat was meet the other 13 students everyone was quiete at first. once everyone arived we were all assigned our own desk with a laptop for the week. We all got to know eachother and met up in the bolger suite and played a few icebreaker games like guessing the celebrity on your back and saying the most intresting fact about yourself, these were extremely fun and made us all have a good laugh. James is the boss and he told us about how ibm own this company and their working ethos etc. The lads here are all sound and we went for a tour of the office together here at Red Hat waterord withone of the workers, Beckie, its very big with over 100 employees in this location alone. We quickly found out there is a free snack bar with loads of sweets and fizzys conveniently beside the gaming area and the pool table. We did i a mini mariokart competition and relaxed for the morning and got used to our surrounding for our week ahead. My favourite employee at this point was james as he was good crack and also likes f1 and ferrari like myself.

We had lunch next and i had a good conversation with one of my new friends alex while i ate my chicken role and a banana that i packed earlier in the morning

In the Bulger suite david gave us a talk about AGILE which is the way the guys work effectivly by setting tasks being open/communicating together to get their day to day tasks for their clients completed fast and to a high standard. Our simple version of this was building mr potatoe heads with their methodolagy. This was effective and much less boring than just sittng and learning.Once it was 4 oclock we finished the day 1 hour early and we continued to get to know the other lads over many games of pool.

Overall day 1 of my week here was very relaxed and more of an introduction and plan about the exiting week ahead.

**My first real day working here at Red Hat**

I was really happy coming in this morning and I came in and met Oisin,Alex,Jack and a few other lads before we started at 9:30 

I checked our whiteboard and and saw what we had for the rest of the day. It started with "stand up"in the bolger suite where we acted like we were on a team together and communicated about the good bad and the improvements about yesterday which were followed with by a brief talk about what was going to be done today. this was exellent as i felt i could try and voice my opinions about what were doing in Red Hat with others.

We stayed in the bolger suite for the next hour and we got try out bash and doing very basic programing/coding. i found this a real challenge at the start but actualy loved it a lot towards the end. Pat was very patient and was always encouraging us to ask for help. This was probably the highlight so far this week and im getting a lot more comfortable with lynex and github. This was followed by doing our blogs as we did not do them on Monday.

Lunch has been a great part of the day and today we set up a pool tornement for the rest of the week.

Once lunch ended we made sure we were on time for ou talk about college life. Being on time had ben a problem yesterday so i made sure not to be late. This talk was led by sean, domnic and jen we asked all our questions about college and courses related to working in Red Hat Sean also told us his story bout how he ended up here its interesting to see how all the workers all did different courses in college and have all ended up with jobs here (information technology)

The last talk in the bolger suite today was our talk with Oksana and she toldus about women in tech, to some it up there is very few women in tech and it would be good if this is encouraged more to girls as at the moment only 20% of tech workers are female in tech workspaces.

To end the day im now writing todas blog and am now finished so ill play a bit of pool before I go home.

## Wednesday
![Red Hat Tys](https://d12oja0ew7x0i8.cloudfront.net/images/Article_Images/ImageForArticle_11958(1).jpg)

I came in this morning and met up with Alex, Oisin, and Jack and we headed to the Bolger suite for our daily discussion about tuesday and what we can do to make today better. A few people had problems with their monitors so we got the fixed and on an uniportant note we ran out of smoothies- Oisin is devistated

At 10:30 we got an important tallk in the Tuskar room about the history of the web, servers and jobs in computers- all the jobs can be so different and its reaaly nice that you can change role in Red Hat and make sure you really are happy in your position James encouraged us to ask him questions but he talked about so many things i had no questions for him.

An intresting fact about the talk was that Red Hat has no pcs here they are all running on a server somewhere else.

Finally just before lunch we did an engineering task to build a tower out of tape and pasta. the winners had a tower 23 inches tall- well off my team with Alex and Kayla, we struggled to keep our tower upright.

In the afternoon myself Oisin,Jack and keelan were on the same team for the 'Engineering Task and we had to make a roller coaster out of straws and cellotape. this took us the two hours we had and then the judges came in who were big higherups from the USA. we won because of our inavatitve spiral and good cellotaping skills by Oisin. 

To end this wednesday i am here writing my blog in the office area.

## Thursday
![Red Hat](https://www.postconsumerbrands.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Buy-Now-Page-Header-Image-2048x1365.webp)

We kicked off our day here in red hat with our "stand up" talk with Jen and Pat  and this was followed with the weekly breakfast in the canteen area. I wasnt hungery but there was loads to choose from.

We then had Sean talk to us about AI as this was todays theme of the day, we disscussed the good with it- the cost effective way of automating tasks and the bad- it is getting rid of peoples jobs

Types of AI: Generative AI,Machine learning AI and Deep learning AI

Dominik then talked to us about Instructlab (its like chatgpt) and we helped him with this software he had developed with others. Myself and 
Alex Created the question when was mariokart 8 released. We then had to put the answer onto this website followed by copied paragraphs of info and we crated other small questions, These were all put up and this now creates the answer for the code domnik made.

In the afternoon Jen got us to do a sustainability presentation on Rain gardens. This was for the purpose of researching about a topic we didnt know about using AI- promt engineering using Perplexity. This AI website was easy to manage and really eay to get answers that are to your needs- in my case very simple, this was easy to get a page worth of information for just myself.
