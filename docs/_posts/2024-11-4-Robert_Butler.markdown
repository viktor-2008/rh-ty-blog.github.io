## TY Work Experience at Red Hat in Waterford city

* 


## Monday
![Red Hat Office](https://ctsgroup.ie/images/made/images/uploads/clients/IMG_0606_960_550_s_c1.JPG "Red Hat Waterford")

I arrived at Red Hat just before 10 and the first thing i did at red hat was meet the other 13 students everyone was quiete at first. once everyone arived we were all assigned our own desk with a laptop for the week. we all got to know eachother and met up in the bolger suite and played a few icebreaker games like guessing the celebrity on your back and saying the most intresting fact about yourself, these were extremely fun and made us all have a good laugh.James is the boss and he told us about how ibm own this company and their working ethos etc. the lads here are all sound and we went for a tour of the office together here at Red Hat waterord withone of the workers, beckie, its very big with over 100 employees in this location alone. we quickly found out there is a free snack bar with loads of sweets and fizzys conveniently beside the gaming area and the pool table. we did i a mini mariokart competition and relaxed for the morning and got used to our surrounding for our week ahead. my favourite employee at this point was james as he was good crack and also likes f1 and ferrari like myself.

we had lunch next and i had a good conversation with one of my new friends alex while i ate my chicken role and a banana that i packed earlier in the morning

In the Bulger suite david gave us a talkabout AGILE which is the way the guys work effectivly by setting tasks being open/communicating together to get their day to day tasks for their clients completed fast and to a high standard. our simple version of this was building mr potatoe heads with their methodolagy. this was effective and much less boring than just sittng and learning.Once it was 4 oclock we finished the day 1 hour early and we continued to get to know the other lads over many games of poo.

overall day 1 of my week here was very relaxed and more of an introduction and plan about the exiting week ahead.

**My first real day working here at Red Hat**

i was really happy coming in this morning and i came in and met oisin,alex,jack and a few other lads before we started at 9:30 

i checked our whiteboard and and saw what we had for the rest of the day. It started with "stand up"in the bolger suite where we acted like we were on a team together and communicated about the good bad and improvements about yesterday followed with by a brieftalk about what was going to be done today. this was exellent as i felt i could try and voice our opinions about what were doing in Red Hat.

we stayed in the bolger suite for the next hour and we got try try out bash and doing very basic programing/coding. i found this a real challenge at the start but actualy loved it a lot towards the end pat was very patient and was always encouraging us to ask for help. this was probably the highlight so far this week and im getting a lot more comfortable with lynex and github. this was followed by doing our blogs as we did not do them on monday.

lunch has been a great part of the day and today we set up a pool tornement for the rest of the week.

once lunch ended we made sure we were on time for ou talk about college life. being on time had ben a problem yesterday so i made sure not to be late. this talk was led by sean, domnic and jen we asked all our questions about college and courses related to working in redhat sean also told us his story bout how he ended up here its interesting to see how all the workers all did different courses and have all ended up with jobs here (information technology)

last talk in the bolger suite today was our talk with oksana and she toldus about wome in tech to some it up there is very few women in tech and it would be good if this is encouraged more to girls as at the moment only 20% of tech workers are female

to end the day im now writing todas blog and am now finished so ill play a bitof pool before i go home
