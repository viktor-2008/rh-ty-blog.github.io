**Welcome My Your Blog!**


## Monday
![Red Hat Office](https://ctsgroup.ie/images/made/images/uploads/clients/IMG_0606_960_550_s_c1.JPG "Red Hat Waterford")

**This is what I did on Monday**.

*On monday we met for the first time in the reception area of the Waterford Red Hat Facility and then we went into our office area to setup our internet and account on our Laptops. 
We were given an office tour, we went all around the office and saw the different workspaces where all the fire exits are and where the canteen/games area is.*

*we were then given an introduction talk from James and what we were told the bassics and what were going to be learning and doing for the week*

*After the office tour we went into the canteen and games area and played the switch and pool table.*
*After a while of playing switch and pool we did a workshop with david and were given a topic to make our mr.potato head with to show how the workers do their work with their team even if they aren't in the same room or on call to comunicate.*

*At the end of the day we went of for the last hour and played more with the pool table until we had to go home.*

## Tuesday

**This is what I did on Tuesday**.

*Today we started our day with a thing where we talk about what we did the day before, about what we liked and what we didn't like and after that we had a small 10 minute break. Right after our break we went and had a mini course on how to code with Pat and learned a few things like how to create files in our folder.*

*Once we were finished with that we went ahead and started our blog on what we had done on Monday and spent 30 minutes on that so we could have it finished for the day. Once we finished that we went off for our hour long lunch break so me and a few of the lads went down the the nearby deli and got lunch there, we then came back and had a few games of pool and started a tournament that we will be doing for the next few days.*

*After our lunch break we went back in for a talk with Seán and Jen about what their expierience in college was like, how much time they spent there and what their course was like. After that we had one last break and came back to a talk about what it's like for women in tech and to see that not many people who are in tech are women.*

*At the end of the day I spent 30 minutes adding to my blog for the day to talk about what I did for the day.*

**This is what I did on Wednesday**.

*We started off our day with  our stand up again where we talk about what we did the previous day and what we like and didn' like or if we had any issue's.*
*After that we fixed our moniters to make sure we can use them with our laptops and then had a small break.*

 
*After our break we went to the Tuskar room and had a talk about technoligy and the cloud with Jmaes and Kevin Quinn who works with Red Hat from home so he was on a Zoom call with us.*

*At 11.30 we did an engineering task with spaghetti and a marshmallow the task was to get the marshmallow off the table as far as possible with out it falling and without anyone toching it. we were in groups of three and sadly my group lost the challenge both times we did and group 3 won both times.*

*Then we had an hour and a half of a lunch break since we finished early and we continued on in our pool tournament and played a bit of switch.*

*After our lunch break we went into the main conference room and did another engineering project where we had to make a roller coaster out of straws and selotape and use a ping pong ball as the cart we made a ramp into a slight loop but it didn't work properly once it got to the end of the ramp*

*For last part of the day I spent a bit writing in this blog to talk about my day*
