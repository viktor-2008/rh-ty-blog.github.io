## Monday
On Monday morning, I came in the doors and we gathered in the reception. We were then shown to our desks and had to sign into our laptops. So, while we waited for everything to get working, they took us to this room called the Bolger room and gave us a quick intro about the office and what we’d be working on. Then they showed us around the place—like, the rooms we can go to, the kitchen, and the games area with a pool table. Oh, and they said we can have all the free snacks we want, so, obviously, that’s happening.

Then we did this icebreaker game where they stuck the name of a celebrity on our back, and we had to go around asking questions to figure out who we were. After all that, we got this massive three-hour break where we mostly played pool and even had a Mario Kart tournament (I’m more into pool, though).

Later, we went back to the Bolger room and learned about this thing called agile. They explained it by giving us Mr. Potato Heads and a theme to design them around. My group got “adventurer” as our theme, and ours was looking pretty solid, honestly. After a couple more breaks, they took us to another room where we made GitHub accounts and learned how to edit our blogs for the week. That only took like half an hour, and we wrapped up a bit early.

Overall, day one was basically just fun and games, but tomorrow we’re diving into blogs and learning about Fedora.

## Tuesday

 ## Tuesday

Today was way more about laptops and coding than the fun we had yesterday. We started with this thing called a standup at 9:30, where we all had to say what we did yesterday and what we’re doing today. Right after, we jumped straight into coding at 10. We started with the Fedora terminal, which was kinda confusing at first, but eventually, we got the hang of it.

By 11, we were working on the first day of the blog. Pat showed us how to use GitHub and edit our blog posts. Lunch was at 1, so me and the guys went up to the shop to grab some food. After lunch, we had a talk about college life, and Jen, Evan, and Sean shared what it was like when they were in college. We squeezed in a quick 10-minute break and kept the pool tournament going that we started at lunch yesterday. Then it was back to the Bolger room for a talk on women in coding, but it was super short since no one had any questions.

Now it’s around 3:30, and I’m working on the Tuesday section of the blog. I have no idea what’s planned for tomorrow, so I’ll just check the whiteboard table in the morning. Also, drank way too much orange soda today.

## Wednesday

Today we started off again with another standup. It only lasted 10 mins and right after we went and worked on our blogs back at the desk. We were slaving away for a while and then we went out and played a bit of mario kart before we went of to the first meeting of the day.

At half 10, we went to the tungsten room where we met peter. He was going to talk to us about how technology has changed in the past couple decades. we also had Kevin who was on a zoom call and david and Jen in the room with us. The talk was interesting and went pretty fast. After this we went back to our desks to work on our blog. we will be meeting jen at Quater to 12 for the next meeting and then we will be on lunch. Before Lunch, we had a challenege to keep a marshmellow as high of the table only using pasta. Obviously my team won both times because we were the best and then we went to lunch. 

After lunch, we went to the bolger suite where Jen explained that we had 2 hours to make a working rollercoaster only using straws,we planned it for a minute and then got to work. The team was me, robert, Oisin and Keelan. We put our heart and souls into this rollercoaster and when everybody else gave up, we kept going. There was people from America who came in to judge our projects but we made their job easy as our one is the only one that worked. We brought the rollercoaster out and put in on display for the office to see in the kitchen

## Thursday

We started of the morning with another standup where Jen, Pat and Dominique explained that today was AI day and we were also getting breakfast at 10 past 10. Before breakfast, we went back to the office to work on our blogs where I finished of my Wednesday blog and now working on my todays blog. After the blog, we went into the kitchen for a bit of grub as on Thursday they do breakfast. 

After breakfast we had Evan come and talk to us about AI and different uses of it. We could tell he was nervous because his mind started to slip. Right after we had a talk with Dominque where he continued with Ai and then got us to make our own AI. Me and Cian were partnered up and we did our one on Spiderman. It took a while as there were loads to do but soon it was lunch and we got to leave.

After Lunch, Jen had us do a project on sustainability where Cian and i were back at it again to drop another banger. we had an hour to do so and after we sat and watched everybody elses presentations.
After we went back to work on our blogs for abit and then we would go to listen tosomeone speak about sports.
