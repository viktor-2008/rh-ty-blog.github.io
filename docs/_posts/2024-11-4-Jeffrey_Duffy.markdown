I arrived at the red hat office at roughly 09:30 and received my laptop,desk and badge.At 10:00 I met everyone else in TY program and did ice breakers and got the tour of the building.We were shown around the desk area and the break area were they have sweets,consoles and a pool room.We had free time until 14:00 were we learned about agile and made mr.Potatoe heads to teach us about the concept.My group made one with the spider-man colour scheme and after a small break we had to talk about the process of making the design of our potatoe head.We then got told a few things that we would be doing over the week like editing this blog.We ended an hour early so I waited in the break area before I got collected by my dad.While waiting I played a bit of pool and drank hot chocolate.
## Tuesday
Today we started earlier than yesterday,instead of 10:00 we started at 09:30 but I didnt have to wake up any later than yesterdaywhich was nice.We started the day by learning bash and basic coding in ternimal  with Pat.We had a few small breaks durning that for about five or ten minutes each.About an half hour before lunch we started working on our blogs for yesterday since we didnt have a chance to work on them yesterday.We started a pool tournamaent today and I went fourth against Victor and won but it was close,I think he only had one or two balls left to pot before the black one.Then at 14:00 we had an employee talk to us for fourty minutes and after that we had a twenty minute break.After that break we had another employee speak with us abot women in the tech industry which was interesting but it was only for about twenty minutes because we didnt have many qustions for her which means were here working on our blogs for today.
