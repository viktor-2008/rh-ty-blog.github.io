**Monday Morning**

We were greeted Monday morning to all the Red Hat staff that were involved in the TY programme, and many of the staff explained to us
what Red Hat is about and what work they have done and the history of Red Hat.

Staff showed us to our desks and gave us a tour around the office showing us the different teams, conference rooms and facilities
across the office. Red Hat has lots of liesurely facilities for staff including TV,switch, xbox, pool table and snacks drinks for employees. 

**Monday tasks/activities**

* Guess the celebrity
* Agile introduction
* Potato head team task

These were all activities that we did throughout the day that allowed all of us to get to know each other
but also learn how Red Hats ecosystem works which uses Agile a team based system where teams come together and learn
how to spot problems and adapt without having fully disregard projects or work. This system provides better work flow
and allows teams and co-workers to learn from each other and allows small changes to happen instead of massive changes
without wasting hours of work.

**Staff that worked with us**
* Gen 
* Pat
* David 
* James

**What we talked about**

For Tuesday the day was more structured and organised. The staff who were working on the TY programme setup a timetable from 9:30am - 4:00pm the day started with "Stand up"
which consisted of explaining the plan for the day what we were doing, and just general house keeping. We started with Bash which was our first lesson learning how to properly code and using the terminal
we learnt about simple commands like echo, locating files and creating a .txt file using the terminal and using code with variables to produce text using x and y variables with Pat.

**GitHub**

Later that day at 11:00am Pat and Gen taught us how to write our blog scripts using the provided template and guides provided by Red Hat and taught us the fundamentals of GitHub as it is
a important part of Red Hat due to been a open source company a they allow anyone to access their code. We learnt about how Red Hat use GitHub as a way of learning and experimenting with code
without the risk of breaking code. GitHub provides a way for staff to learn what works and what doesn't and also working as a team.

**Student Life & Women in Tech**

After Lunch we tlked about what it's lik to be a student in college and the different paths you can take after getting your degree. We talked to Sean and Jen about both their college experiences.
We also spoke with Oxona who came to Ireland 2 years ago from ukraine she gave us an insight about what it is like to be a women in the tech industry
