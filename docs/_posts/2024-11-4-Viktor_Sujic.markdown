Mon, Nov 5th, 2024
-----------------
I arrived at the building, and we had some time to ourselves until around 9:30 AM. We had some time for ourselvess but I was mostly alone in the canteen. 
during this time I hid in the lounge area and listened to music and tried out some snacks.
We came in into the Bolger Suite and had a small talk with James. We played a famous-person guesing game with pieces of paper taped to our backs.
We introduced ourselves to eachother, and I mentioned that when I was 4 I caught a catfish.

We had a 1.5- 2 hr long break until work started in around 11:00.
We used this break to hang out in the canteen and play on the Wii. Me and the lads messed around on the pool table.
When we came back we had another talk with David. We had a talk about some sort of productivity technique called "Agile".
We also built a Mr. Potato head. Me, and the other lads in my team showed it off in front of the class. 
We then had a 10 min break where I messed around on the pool table again.

We took our laptops and created our Github Account. We created our forks, through which I'm writing this blog!
We then had another break until the end of the day. And, as you may have guessed, i messed on the pool table again.
We left at 5:00pm

## Tuesday, Nov 6th, 2024.
------------------------
I came in at around 9:00, and didn't have as much leisure time today as I did yesterday,but I still managed.
We came into the bolger suite again and this time we did our stand-up where we talked about what went right and
what went wrong yesterday. 
We then had a rather lengthy coding session where we were learning about a 
language called Bash. We learned how to create text files and some basic coding.
We created our first line of code. 

Meanwhile in the canteen the lads had a pool tournament on. During round 4 it was me against Alex. I lost, but very narrowly.
