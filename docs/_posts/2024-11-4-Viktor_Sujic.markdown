Mon, Nov 5th, 2024
-----------------
I arrived at the building, and we had some time to ourselves until around 9:30 AM. We had some time for ourselvess but I was mostly alone in the canteen. 
during this time I hid in the lounge area and listened to music and tried out some snacks.
We came in into the Bolger Suite and had a small talk with James. We played a famous-person guesing game with pieces of paper taped to our backs.
We introduced ourselves to eachother, and I mentioned that when I was 4 I caught a catfish.

We had a 1.5- 2 hr long break until work started in around 11:00.
We used this break to hang out in the canteen and play on the Wii. Me and the lads messed around on the pool table.
When we came back we had another talk with David. We had a talk about some sort of productivity technique called "Agile".
We also built a Mr. Potato head. Me, and the other lads in my team showed it off in front of the class. 
We then had a 10 min break where I messed around on the pool table again.

We took our laptops and created our Github Account. We created our forks, through which I'm writing this blog!
We then had another break until the end of the day. And, as you may have guessed, i messed on the pool table again.
We left at 5:00pm

## Tuesday, Nov 6th, 2024.
------------------------
I came in at around 9:00, and didn't have as much leisure time today as I did yesterday,but I still managed.
We came into the bolger suite again and this time we did our stand-up where we talked about what went right and
what went wrong yesterday. 
We then had a rather lengthy coding session where we were learning about a 
language called Bash. We learned how to create text files and some basic coding.
We created our first line of code. 
Afterwards we learned more about Github, such as where everything is, how to make  pull request, how to make a commit, ect.

Meanwhile in the canteen the lads had a pool tournament on. During round 4 it was me against Jeffrey. I lost, but very narrowly.

After lunch, we had a "Student Life" talk, where an employee called Shane came in and told us about his life in college.
He told us about how if you do something you enjoy, it won't be as boring. We also heard a little speech from his
friend whose name I can't remember- but they both reccomended college to us as a carreer-boosting choice.

A lady from Ukraine came in. She said that she came here because of the war and is currently in college.
Funnily enough each talk lasted about 15 minutes but there were 40 minutes left in the session- and barely 
anyone had questions afterwards, which made things drag on slower.
We had some time afterwards to finish our blogs. Looking back I should've taken advantage of that time and completed my
tuesday blog instead of leaving early because now I have to finish it today.
I left early and walked home.

## Wednesday, November 6th, 2024.

I arrived at 9:00 and had more freetime early on than yesterday. Although I accidentaly locked meself in because I didn't know where
my swipe card was. I asked someone else to let me in and found it inside my jacket pocket when I thought it was at home.
We did our stand-ups (Talking about the day before) in the bolger suite. Unfortunately there is a shortage of smoothies in the fridge as some lads pointed out.

We then went into a smaller green-walled room on the other side of the building and saw a presentation on the History
of Computing. It went into detail about The Cloud, Amazon and how they started off selling books, and just the progress 
of technology in the modern world in general. I was the one who asked the most questions and got a pen as 
a prize.
Afterwards we did an activity which involved trying to make a structure out of spaghetti which we could use to
put a marshmallow on top of. Whoever built the highest statue won a bag of mallows.
Me and my team got about third-best- although this was out of teams of four so not great.

After lunch- during which I played a round of pool-  we returned to the bolger suite and had
a competition to see who could build the best rollercoaster out of nothing but straws and tape.
Who would determine which coaster was the best? three American men who came in
and reviewed our contraptions. The first team won- because, well, it was the only one that worked without half-collapsing-
but my one got some compliments here and there too.

I had some time afterwards to work on these blogs and left at 5:00.
